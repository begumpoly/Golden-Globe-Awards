The data suggests a bias in Golden Globe award distribution, with films consistently receiving more recognition than television shows. Historically, film awards have outnumbered TV awards, reinforcing the perception that movies hold greater prestige. While television awards have increased over time, the disparity remains, indicating an institutional preference for film. Addressing this bias could lead to a more balanced recognition of achievements across both industries.we will explore more by performing the statistical data.
